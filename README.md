## Hey friend, thanks for stopping by!
I help hands-on technical leads (CTOs, Engineering Managers, Tech Leads) go from being chief problem-solvers to strategic leaders.

There's three stages:

ðŸ”¥ We put out the fires. (Analyze)

ðŸ’ª We empower the team, so they can take over the hands-on tasks. (Delegate)

ðŸ“ˆ We carve out time for strategic work that helps the business nail its goals. (Strategize)

## My Mission
> Iâ€™m on a mission to empower **1.000 leaders** to create **thriving tech teams** that **developers love to be in** and **businesses are proud to have**.
